## Key Features:
  - Deadline-Driven Scheduling – Uses Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and hybrid scheduling for maximum CPU utilization.
  - Dynamic Priority Management – Adjusts task priorities based on real-time execution constraints.
  - Priority Inheritance & Resource Awareness – Prevents priority inversion and accounts for task dependencies.
  - Adaptive Execution Time Estimation – Handles task runtime variations dynamically for better predictability.
  - Optimized Non-Periodic Task Scheduling – Ensures urgent tasks execute efficiently without disrupting periodic tasks.

## Project Goals:
  - Improve real-time task scheduling efficiency in FreeRTOS-based systems.
  - Reduce latency and overhead while maintaining strict deadline adherence.
  - Provide an open-source, research-backed scheduling framework for embedded systems.
